# Shook
In this increasingly flighty society, most apps are indulging our desire to reduce our accountability. Not anymore. Shook is an agreement app that can make, track, and enforce deals between friends, family members, coworkers and anyone in between. Never let your friend back out of a bet again and keep your kids on their chore grind with Shook. **Let's Shake On It!**

### Daily Progress

##### Day 1 - Planning
The team sat down with no idea what to do for our fourth and final Web Development Immersive project. We asked everyone for app ideas: our cohort, passing instructors, anyone who would listen but didn't hear anything that resonated with the group as a whole. We took to the internet to see if we could find some inspiration and we were not disappointed. The idea for Shook began to form out of a fun idea for a simple dare app.

With the initial 'Shake' model sketched, core features listed out and stretch features ranked by ease of implementation, the team left to work on user stories.

##### Day 2 - Base Code + App Connectivity
Connecting Django and React was a harder task than anticipated. The Shook team spent an afternoon running through a multitude of online tutorials on how to get the React frontend to speak to the Django backend. The core of the day was spent on ensuring this connection was solid before divvying up the component builds.

##### Day 3 - React Router + Token Authentication
Another intense day of connectivity issues! This time, the team was dealing with token authentication and React Router. While half the developers spent their time testing different solutions for routing, the other half built out the base components and the 'Shake' model. Albeit stressful, the team accomplished all the goals laid out in the scrum meeting beforehand. For take home, the goals were to fine tune the routing, add login and sign up functionality, and add wireframed styling to the components.
